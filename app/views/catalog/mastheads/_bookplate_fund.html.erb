          The library resources listed below were acquired with the generous support of this endowed materials fund.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donors and family representatives who have created and sustained library endowments ensure the most relevant research materials are available to students, faculty and scholars in perpetuity, a tradition started by Jane Stanford when she created the first library endowment from the proceeds of the sale of her jewel collection.
